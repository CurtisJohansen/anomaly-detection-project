# Anomaly Detection Project


### Description

Look at the data in order to find trends and abnormalities in the Codeup Curriculum Access Log.

### Deliverables

Create a notebook for review, a single slide to document our finds similar to an executive summary and reply to the email with our discoveries.

### Project Questions

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
2. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
3. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
4. Which lessons are least accessed? 
5. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?

### Findings

There are 4 different programs available in the dataset:
    - PHP Full Stack (Web Development)
    - Java Full Stack (Web Development)
    - Data Science
    - Front End (Web Development)

There seems to be some suspicious activity going on with one user accessing 272 pages in the curriculum over a short duration.
    - This user also used a few different IP addresses.
    
There were 468 pages in the curriculum which were only accessed once.
    - Some of these pages were found to be lessons while the others were professional development pages.
    
The following lessons were accessed post graduation:
    - Data Science: SQL, Classification Overview, Classification Scaling
    - Full-Stack Java: Javascript-I, HTML-CSS, Spring
    - Front End: Javascript-I, HTML-CSS, Spring
